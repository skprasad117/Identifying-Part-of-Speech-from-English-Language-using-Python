## Identifying-Part-of-Speech-from-English-Language-using-Python
This is a Python project that demonstrates how to identify the part-of-speech (POS) of words in the English language using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.

## Description

Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning a grammatical tag to each word in a given text. In this project,NLTK's POS tagging functionality is used to analyze and tag words based on their part of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and more.

## Features

- Tokenization of text into individual words or sentences.
- POS tagging of words using NLTK's built-in tagger.
- Identification of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pronouns in the text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library 
```
pip intall -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Install required library.
2. Run the Python script `main.py` to see an example of how to identify the part-of-speech in a given text.
3. Customize the script to process your own text.
